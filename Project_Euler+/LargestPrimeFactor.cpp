/**
 * Project Euler #3: Largest Prime Factor
 * The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13, and 29.
 * What is the largest prime factor of a given number N?
 *
 * Input Format: First line contains T, the number of test cases. This is
 *               followed by T lines each containing an integer N.
 *
 * Output Format: For each test case, display the largest prime factor of N.

    // the larger number must be the last prime factor. So there cannot possibly
    // be more than a few million trial divisions to do."
